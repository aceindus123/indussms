We are soliciting enquiries from channel partners across the country in Metros as well as the 'A' and 'B' class cities to enable high penetration in mobile SMS messaging software and services markets as there is a huge untapped potential waiting to be explored. Our Partner Program's objective is to leverage our strengths along with our Partners to help achieve quick growth in the business of providing SMS Solutions to customers.

<p> You can start your own branded SMS reseller website with our web server connectivity.

<p> You buy message units from us at a wholesale price and then resell them to your customers in small batches at whatever price you want. The more customers you have, the more messages they send and the more messages you buy the lesser is your SMS cost. The higher the price per message you charge them, the more money you make.
